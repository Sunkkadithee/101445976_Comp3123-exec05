# Express.js Basics with Routing

#### Section A: Practical Coding Tasks

**1. Creating an Express.js Route for Home Page**

- Write a route in Express.js that serves a `home.html` file. Create a new HTML file called `home.html` that contains an `<h1>` tag with the message "Welcome to ExpressJs Tutorial". Ensure that the home page is served to the client when the `/home` route is accessed.


home.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Home</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to ExpressJs Tutorial</h1>
</body>
</html>


Add a route to serve home.html to index.js

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

app.get('/home', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'home.html'));
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 8080');
});







**2. Serving JSON Data from a User File**

- Modify the route `/profile` to return all details from a `user.json` file in JSON format. The file should be sent as a response when a client makes a request to the `/profile` route.


const fs = require('fs');

app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
    fs.readFile('user.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(500).json({ error: "Error reading the user data" });
        }
        res.json(JSON.parse(data));
    });
});








**3. Implementing User Authentication**

- Modify the `/login` route to accept `username` and `password` as JSON body parameters.
- Read user data from `user.json` file.
- If the `username` and `password` are valid, return the following response:

    ```json
    {
        "status": true,
        "message": "User Is valid"
    }
    ```

- If the `username` is invalid, return:

    ```json
    {
        "status": false,
        "message": "User Name is invalid"
    }
    ```

- If the `password` is invalid, return:

    ```json
    {
        "status": false,
        "message": "Password is invalid"
    }
    ```
    
    
CODE: 

    app.use(express.json());

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;

    fs.readFile('user.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) return res.status(500).json({ error: "Error reading user data" });

        const user = JSON.parse(data);

        if (username !== user.username) {
            return res.json({ status: false, message: "User Name is invalid" });
        }
        if (password !== user.password) {
            return res.json({ status: false, message: "Password is invalid" });
        }

        res.json({ status: true, message: "User Is valid" });
    });
});

    
    

    
    

**4. Creating a Logout Route**

- Modify the `/logout` route to accept a `username` as a parameter.
- Return a message in HTML format that displays `<b>{username} successfully logged out.<b>` when a user accesses the `/logout` route.

Code:
app.get('/logout/:username', (req, res) => {
    const username = req.params.username;
    res.send(`<b>${username} successfully logged out.</b>`);
});





**5. Add error handling middleware to handle below error**

- Return 500 page with message "Server Error"
```
app.use((err,req,res,next) => {
  res.send('This is error router');
});
```

CODE:
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(500).send('<h1>Server Error</h1>');
});

#### Section B: Short Answer Questions

**6. Explain the Purpose of `express.Router()` in the Code Above.**

- Why is `express.Router()` used in Express.js applications, and how does it benefit the code structure?

allows you to organize your routes by splitting them into separate files or components by using Router.





**7. Error Handling in Express.js**

- How would you implement error handling in the Express routes to ensure that any issues (such as file not found or server errors) are appropriately handled? Provide an example.

use  parameters: err, req, res, and next. How did I do in code bellow:
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.status(404).send('Page not found');
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error' });
});

#### Section C: Bonus

**7. Dynamic Port Binding in Express.js**

- Explain how the `app.listen(process.env.port || 8081)` line works and why it's useful in production environments.

app.listen(process.env.port || 8081) allows the application to bind to a port specified in server

# Submission Guideline
 Process of creating a ZIP file, GitHub repository, and gathering screenshots as per your instructions. Here’s the step-by-step guide to complete the exercise:

### Step 1: Complete the Exercise

1. **Understand the Node/Express/Routes Project:**
   - Open the provided exercise project.
   - Go through the source code and ensure all comments and instructions are followed carefully.

2. **Fix Any Errors:**
   - Run the project locally and test it using Postman (or another tool).
   - If you encounter any errors, review the error messages and adjust the code accordingly. Ensure the API routes and responses are working properly.

3. **Capture Screenshots:**
   - After testing in Postman, take screenshots of the output and any errors you encounter.
   - Save these screenshots for submission later.

### Step 2: Create ZIP File

1. **Prepare the Project Files:**
   - Make sure your project is structured properly, with all necessary files like `package.json`, route files, controllers, etc.
   - If there are any `node_modules`, remove them to keep the ZIP file smaller.

2. **Zip the Project:**
   - On Windows: Right-click on your project folder, select "Send to" > "Compressed (zipped) folder".
   - On Mac: Right-click the project folder and choose "Compress".
   - Rename the ZIP file to `StudentID_COMP3123-exec05.zip` (replace `StudentID` with your actual student ID).

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Create a New Repository:**
   - Click on the `+` icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name the repository `StudentID_COMP3123-exec05` (replace `StudentID` with your actual student ID).
   - Choose to initialize it with a `README.md` (optional) and set visibility (public or private).

3. **Push Your Code to GitHub:**
   - If you haven’t done so already, open your terminal and navigate to your project folder.
   - Initialize a git repository using the following commands:

     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

   - Link the GitHub repository:

     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/StudentID_COMP3123-exec05.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

### Step 4: Upload Screenshots

1. **Upload Screenshots to the Repository:**
   - You can upload your screenshots directly into the GitHub repository by dragging and dropping them into the main directory (or any folder structure you like).

2. **Include Postman Screenshots:**
   - Make sure to include the screenshots of Postman responses in your GitHub repository as part of the submission.

### Step 5: Submission

1. **Submit the GitHub Link:**
   - Copy the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/StudentID_COMP3123-exec05`).
   - Share this URL according to your course submission guidelines (via email or SLACK).

2. **Include ZIP File if Needed:**
   - Attach the ZIP file (`StudentID_COMP3123-exec05.zip`) along with your submission, if required.
